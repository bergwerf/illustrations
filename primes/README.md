# A binary Turing machine to recognize primes

This binary Turing machine recognizes primes. Its description is slightly 
different from usual since each state writes and moves rather than the state 
transition. This was inspired by [1].

The file `primes-old.svg` contains an older (and incorrect) version of the 
machine. The machine description is included in a different form in 
`primes.txt`.
